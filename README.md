Machine learning project for predicting potential heart disease based on parameters commonly observed during diagnostic screenings.
To achieve this, a dataset was analyzed, created by combining multiple datasets previously made available by various hospital centers. 
The project is developed in Python using both PyTorch and Scikit-learn. It involves the use of five binary classification models (Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest). 
Each model was evaluated using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, macro avg, and weighted avg), and a confusion matrix was generated and visualized. 
The performance of the models was compared graphically, and finally, testing was conducted on new data.
